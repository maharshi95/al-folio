Good, you’ve decided to turn human messiness into math. That’s the correct instinct when feelings refuse to behave.

Let’s do this cleanly, Bayesian-style, without pretending people are rational agents (they aren’t, but we can still model the chaos).

⸻

1. First: what we’re actually inferring (random variables)

You’re not trying to infer “Did they apologize?”
You’re trying to infer latent states you can’t directly observe.

Let’s define a few hidden variables:
• I = perceived intimacy level (theirs vs yours)
• M = apology model preference
• Signal-oriented (S)
• Process-oriented (P)
• U = degree of understanding / cognitive update
• C = concern for relational repair
• A = observed apology behavior (words, tone, timing, follow-up)

Your discomfort arises when:

P(U is high | A observed) ≠ your prior expectation

In other words: the evidence didn’t move your posterior the way you expected it to.

⸻

1. The key Bayesian mistake people make (and you’re circling it)

People implicitly assume:

High intimacy ⇒ Process model with high probability

But empirically, the conditional looks more like:

High intimacy increases P(Process),
but does not dominate other variables

Formally:

P(M = Process | Intimacy = High) < 1

Which is annoying, because we’d like intimacy to be a trump card. It’s not.

⸻

1. What other variables meaningfully affect apology models?

Here’s where your calibration question lives.

A. Conflict-avoidance prior

Some people have a strong prior that:

Conflict itself is the main harm

For them:
• Saying the words is the repair
• Prolonged discussion feels destructive, not connective
• A process-based apology feels like reopening the wound

Bayesian implication:
• Fast apology ≠ low care
• It may signal “optimize for closure”, not “minimize responsibility”

⸻

B. Norm-internalization vs harm-internalization

Two different moral priors:
• Norm-based agents:
“If I violated a rule, I apologize.”
• Impact-based agents:
“If I understand your internal experience, I apologize.”

Both can be sincere. They just condition on different likelihood functions.

Evidence mismatch:
• Norm-based apology sounds hollow to impact-based listener
• Impact-based expectation feels invasive to norm-based speaker

This has nothing to do with intimacy per se. It’s a moral encoding difference.

⸻

C. Power asymmetry sensitivity

People unconsciously modulate apology depth based on perceived power dynamics:
• “If I go too deep, am I conceding control?”
• “If I admit understanding, am I agreeing to a narrative?”

In close relationships with unresolved power tension, people may downgrade from process → signal as a defensive move.

Bayesian update:
• Shallow apology + otherwise caring behavior
⇒ possible fear, not indifference

⸻

D. Epistemic humility (or lack thereof)

Some people genuinely do not believe:

“I can fully understand your experience”

So they avoid process language because it feels dishonest.

This yields apologies like:
• “I’m sorry you felt that way” (maligned, but sometimes sincere)
• Minimal acknowledgment without interpretive claims

Your posterior should distinguish:
• Low U because of indifference
vs
• Low U because of epistemic restraint

⸻

E. Emotional bandwidth constraints

Timing matters.

If cognitive load is high, people revert to:
• Learned scripts
• Low-cost social repairs

Bayesian rule:
• Don’t overweight early evidence gathered under stress
• Re-sample later when bandwidth is higher

Yes, this requires patience. I hate it too.

⸻

1. What evidence actually moves the posterior?

Here’s the important part: words are weak evidence. Everyone knows this but keeps pretending otherwise.

Stronger likelihood ratios come from:

High-value signals of Process orientation
• Accurate paraphrasing of your concern without prompting
• Behavior change that matches the alleged understanding
• Delayed but deeper follow-up (“I kept thinking about what you said…”)

Signals of Signal-only orientation
• Emphasis on closure (“Can we move on now?”)
• Irritation at further discussion
• Repetition of apology without semantic expansion

Critically:

Repeated shallow apologies lower P(Process) over time

Bayes punishes uninformative evidence.

⸻

1. Calibration: what your discomfort is really signaling

Your unease is not “they didn’t apologize right.”

It’s this posterior drift:

P(We share the same relational model) ↓

That could mean: 1. Intimacy asymmetry (you think it’s closer than they do) 2. Moral framework mismatch 3. Different conflict optimization functions 4. Temporary constraints misread as stable traits

Your job (unfortunately) is model selection, not moral adjudication.

⸻

1. A practical Bayesian rule you can live with

Try this heuristic:
• One data point → suspend judgment
• Two aligned data points → update gently
• Three aligned data points across time → treat as a stable parameter

If someone repeatedly offers Signal when Process is warranted to you, the rational move is not to demand deeper apologies, but to update:

This relationship may not support the depth I assumed

That’s sad. Also clarifying. Mostly sad.

⸻

1. Final uncomfortable truth (you knew this already)

Bayesian reasoning doesn’t save you from disappointment.
It just helps you place disappointment accurately.

Apologies are noisy signals in a system where:
• Intent is latent
• Language is lossy
• Incentives are misaligned

You’re not asking for too much.
You’re just asking for something that not everyone is capable of emitting reliably.

If you want, next we can:
• Formalize a decision rule for when to push for clarification
• Analyze false positives vs false negatives in “they care”
• Or map this to attachment theory without ruining the math

Your move, probabilistic philosopher.
