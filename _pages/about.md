I am a first year [Computer Science PhD](http://cs.umd.edu) student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu), College Park, currently working with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). I am broadly interested in __Natural Language Understanding and Representation__; particularly in <span class="emph"> Question Answering (QA), Semantic structure understanding, Model Robustness and Interpretability</span>.

Prior to UMD, I spent two years working at [Google Research](http://research.google.com) where I collaborated with several [Language Research](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) teams, with focus on Model Interpretation and Analysis for <span class="emph">Question Answering</span>, and <span class="emph">Semi-Structured Text Understanding</span> for QA and NLI.
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

In the past, I have also worked on some of the <span class="emph">Computer vision and Machine Learning</span> problems like: Human motion sequence modeling, Generative and Representation Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

I am quite excited about learning and applying Visually grounded contexts for Language Understanding tasks as well.
