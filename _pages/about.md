I am a second year [Computer Science PhD](http://cs.umd.edu) student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu), College Park, currently working with [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/) and [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). I am a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) at [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/).
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

I am broadly interested in __Natural Language Understanding__ and __Efficient learning methods;__ particularly around <span class="emph"> Question Answering (QA), Semantic structure understanding, Model Robustness and Interpretability</span>.
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

I've spent some time working at [Google Research](http://research.google.com) where I collaborated [Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) with several [Language Research](https://research.google/research-areas/natural-language-processing/) teams, with focus on Model Interpretation and Analysis for <span class="emph">Question Answering</span>, <span class="emph">Semi-Structured Text Understanding</span> and <span class="emph">Retrieval-augmented Language models</span> for long-context understanding.
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

In the past, I have also worked on some of the <span class="emph">Computer vision and Machine Learning</span> problems like Human motion sequence modeling, Generative and Representation Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.
{: style="text-align: justify;" }

In my free time, I like to engage in social deception board games. I also very much like to play [Magic the Gathering](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Magic:_The_Gathering) :)
<!-- I am quite excited about learning and applying Visually grounded contexts for Language Understanding tasks as well.
